For her eyes only.

365
00:33:49,322 --> 00:33:50,990
She's ready for you.

366
00:33:51,637 --> 00:33:53,847
I'm sorry, have we met before?

367
00:33:54,194 --> 00:33:56,320
I'm the one who
should say "sorry".

368
00:33:57,195 --> 00:33:59,030
lt was only four ribs.

369
00:34:00,425 --> 00:34:02,635
Some of the less vital organs.

370
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:04,867
Nothing major.

371
00:34:08,228 --> 00:34:09,812
Not enough
excitement in Istanbul?

372
00:34:12,137 --> 00:34:13,721
I've been reassigned.

373
00:34:14,657 --> 00:34:16,741
Temporary suspension
from field work.

374
00:34:17,153 --> 00:34:18,570
Really?
Mmm.

375
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:20,432
Something to do
with killing 007.

376
00:34:21,161 --> 00:34:22,912
Well, you gave it
your best shot.

377
00:34:23,086 --> 00:34:24,837
That was hardly my best shot.

378
00:34:25,074 --> 00:34:27,075
I'm not sure I
could survive your best.

379
00:34:27,125 --> 00:34:28,876
I doubt you'll get the chance.

380
00:34:29,115 --> 00:34:32,117
Well, do me a favor, will you?
If they do ever let
you back out there,

381
00:34:32,851 --> 00:34:34,018
warn me first.

382
00:34:35,289 --> 00:34:37,957
I'm assisting Gareth Mallory
in the transition,

383
00:34:38,572 --> 00:34:40,406
and then I'll be
back in the field.

384
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,617
That's what you want?

385
00:34:41,765 --> 00:34:43,182
Yes, of course.

386
00:34:43,645 --> 00:34:45,145
It's not for everyone.

387
00:34:45,585 --> 00:34:47,836
Ah, 007. It's this way.

388
00:34:47,755 --> 00:34:52,592
ln your defense,
a moving target is
much harder to hit.

389
00:34:53,726 --> 00:34:55,477
Then you better keep moving.

390
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:08,310
The whole office
goes up in smoke

391
00:35:09,523 --> 00:35:11,274
and that bloody
thing survives.

392
00:35:11,768 --> 00:35:15,271

have always been appreciated,
007.

393

394
00:35:19,286 --> 00:35:20,703
I hope I haven't
missed anything.

398
00:35:26,852 --> 00:35:29,520
I've just been
reviewing Bond's tests.

399
00:35:30,126 --> 00:35:33,462
lt seems you've passed. . .
by the skin of your teeth.

400
00:35:34,973 --> 00:35:36,807
You're back on active service.

401
00:35:37,651 --> 00:35:38,776
Congratulations.

402
00:35:39,194 --> 00:35:40,319
Thank you.

403
00:35:40,926 --> 00:35:42,426
I'll, um. . .

404
00:35:42,426 --> 00:35:43,551
I'll be outside.

405
00:35:44,229 --> 00:35:46,396
I only have one question.

406
00:35:47,219 --> 00:35:49,387
Why not stay dead?

407
00:35:49,609 --> 00:35:52,986
You have the perfect way out.
Go and live quietly somewhere.

408
00:35:53,476 --> 00:35:56,395
Not many field
agents get to leave
this cleanly.

409
00:35:57,011 --> 00:35:58,553
Do you get out
in the field much?

410
00:35:59,905 --> 00:36:03,115
You don't need
to be an operative
to see the obvious.

411
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,969
It's a young man's game.

412
00:36:06,485 --> 00:36:08,152
Look, you've been
seriously injured.

413
00:36:08,701 --> 00:36:11,035
There's no shame in saying
you've lost a step.

414
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,921
The only shame would
be not admitting it
until it's too late.

415
00:36:15,578 --> 00:36:18,496
Hire me or fire me.
It's entirely up to you.

416
00:36:18,527 --> 00:36:20,862
If he says he's ready,
he's ready.

417
00:36:21,718 --> 00:36:24,429
Perhaps you can't see it,
or maybe you won't.

418
00:36:25,263 --> 00:36:26,889
What exactly are you implying?

419
00:36:28,078 --> 00:36:29,453
You're sentimental about him.

420
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:33,991
As long as I'm head
of this department,
I'll choose my own operatives.

421
00:36:36,631 --> 00:36:38,049
Fair enough.

422
00:36:40,552 --> 00:36:42,594
Good luck, 007.

423
00:36:44,625 --> 00:36:46,543
Don't cock it up.

424
00:36:54,076 --> 00:36:57,162
We've analyzed
the shrapnel fragments.

425
00:36:57,066 --> 00:36:58,358
You're lucky it
wasn't a direct hit

426
00:36:58,529 --> 00:36:59,863
or it would have
cut you in half.

427
00:37:00,666 --> 00:37:03,918
It's a depleted uranium shell.
Military grade.

428
00:37:05,001 --> 00:37:07,044
Hard to get,
extremely expensive,

429
00:37:07,261 --> 00:37:09,929
and only used by a select few.

430
00:37:10,589 --> 00:37:12,006
Recognize anyone?

431
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:14,820
Him.

432
00:37:15,589 --> 00:37:18,048
TANNER: Okay. Name's Patrice.

433
00:37:18,156 --> 00:37:20,574
He's a ghost.
No known residence
or country of origin.

434
00:37:20,372 --> 00:37:21,956
So how do we find him?

435
00:37:22,146 --> 00:37:25,356
Well, luckily, we still have
one or two
friends left in the CIA.

436
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,811
They're after him for
the Yemeni ambassador's
murder,

437
00:37:27,732 --> 00:37:29,483
and they're getting close.

438
00:37:30,145 --> 00:37:31,979
Intel is he's
going to be in Shanghai

439
00:37:32,298 --> 00:37:34,091
in two days time,
probably on a job.

440
00:37:34,164 --> 00:37:36,332
You're to go there
and await
further instructions.

441
00:37:36,468 --> 00:37:38,344
If he turns up, he's yours.

442
00:37:38,697 --> 00:37:41,990
Find out who he works for
and who has the list.

443
00:37:41,824 --> 00:37:43,616
Then terminate him,
for Ronson.

444
00:37:44,689 --> 00:37:46,023

else you want to tell me?

446

No.

the new Quartermaster
for your documentation.

448
00:37:55,281 --> 00:37:57,282
He hasn't set up
shop yet, but Tanner will

449

put you two together.
Good luck.

453
00:38:09,868 --> 00:38:11,202
Yes, ma'am.

454
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:17,835

passed the tests.

I'm your new Quartermaster.

466

You must be joking.

467
00:39:20,226 --> 00:39:22,060
Why, because I'm not
wearing a lab coat?

468
00:39:22,538 --> 00:39:24,581
Because you still have spots.

469
00:39:25,608 --> 00:39:27,442
My complexion is
hardly relevant.

470
00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:30,204
Well, your competence is.

471
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:33,324
Age is no
guarantee of efficiency.

472
00:39:33,361 --> 00:39:36,113

00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:22,205
Are you putting your life
in my hands again?

542
00:53:23,393 --> 00:53:24,602

543
00:53:25,646 --> 00:53:28,106

544
00:53:29,485 --> 00:53:31,486

the tantalizing question

545
00:53:31,611 --> 00:53:33,612
of what you're
really doing here.

546
00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:38,454
My official
directive was to help. . .

547
00:53:38,813 --> 00:53:40,897
"in any way I can."

548
00:53:42,071 --> 00:53:44,739
Like spying for Mallory.

549
00:53:45,779 --> 00:53:48,489
You know, Mallory's not as bad
as you think.

550
00:53:51,547 --> 00:53:53,381
He's a bureaucrat.

551
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:56,399
You should do your homework.

552
00:53:56,587 --> 00:53:59,047
Gareth Mallory was
a Lieutenant Colonel. . .

553
00:53:59,843 --> 00:54:02,553
Lieutenant Colonel
in Northern Ireland,
Hereford Regiment.

554
00:54:03,454 --> 00:54:05,914
Spent three months
at the hands of the IRA.

555
00:54:05,674 --> 00:54:06,674
(CHUCKLES)

556
00:54:06,945 --> 00:54:09,739

him than meets the eye.

(INHALES DEEPLY)

558
00:54:11,838 --> 00:54:13,172

559

Keep still.

560
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:20,060
This is the tricky part.

561
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,917

562
00:54:36,121 --> 00:54:37,246

563
00:54:38,366 --> 00:54:40,075
Mm-hmm.
Mmm.

564
00:54:40,749 --> 00:54:42,583
And what part's that?

565
00:54:44,192 --> 00:54:45,734

566
00:54:47,733 --> 00:54:49,567

567
00:55:49,551 --> 00:55:51,010

568
00:56:01,934 --> 00:56:03,351
EVE: Evening.

569
00:56:04,504 --> 00:56:06,296
Don't touch your ear.

570
00:56:07,577 --> 00:56:09,578
I've got three exits,

571
00:56:10,316 --> 00:56:12,275
lots of blind spots.

572
00:56:12,962 --> 00:56:14,588
EVE: I've got them covered.

573
00:56:17,801 --> 00:56:19,843
You look
beautiful in that dress.

574
00:56:21,410 --> 00:56:23,077
You don't scrub
up so bad yourself.

575
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:26,424
It's amazing what one can do
with an extra pair of hands.

576
00:56:27,877 --> 00:56:29,544
You're telling me.

577
00:56:30,226 --> 00:56:31,935
Do you gamble?

578
00:56:33,653 --> 00:56:35,362

flutter now and then.

to take chances?

Good evening, sir.
How may I help you?

581
00:56:47,433 --> 00:56:49,476
I'd like to cash
this in, please.

582
00:56:57,332 --> 00:56:58,791
One moment, sir.

583
00:57:26,377 --> 00:57:27,920
Good fortune tonight, sir.

584
00:57:39,385 --> 00:57:40,886
Let's hope so.

585
00:57:45,311 --> 00:57:46,978
With compliments
of the house.

586
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:50,789
Thank you.

587
00:58:10,929 --> 00:58:13,598
Now you can afford
to buy me a drink.

588
00:58:15,959 --> 00:58:18,293
Maybe I'll even
stretch to two.

589
00:58:21,222 --> 00:58:23,682
I'm guessing I've
got four million euros
in here.

590
00:58:24,951 --> 00:58:27,453
Not bad. I like this game.

591

I don't gamble.

593
00:58:33,755 --> 00:58:35,631
I'm not very lucky.

594
00:58:37,232 --> 00:58:39,400
A little like our
friend in Shanghai.

595
00:58:40,875 --> 00:58:44,211
I've been waiting to see
who would redeem the chip.

596
00:58:46,283 --> 00:58:49,785
You made such a bold entrance
into our little drama.

597
00:58:50,593 --> 00:58:52,720
Did I over-complicate
the plot?

598

if I asked you
a business question?

you're well-versed.

And how would you know that?

618
01:00:02,825 --> 01:00:05,661

wears a backless dress

619

strapped to her thigh.

too careful when

622

assuming you killed Patrice?

623

Yes.

624

you haven't stopped

Now, three of them
is a bit excessive.

They're controlling you.
They're not protecting you.

is Macau sex trade.

thought you were in love.

know about fear?

But I didn't die.

896
01:23:15,764 --> 01:23:18,516
Life clung to me
like a disease.

897
01:23:26,713 --> 01:23:27,880
And then. . .

898
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:31,674
I understood why
I had survived.

899
01:23:32,219 --> 01:23:35,888
I needed to look in
your eyes one last time.

900
01:23:37,594 --> 01:23:39,053
Well, I hope it was worth it.

901
01:23:41,742 --> 01:23:45,078
Mr. Silva, you're
going to be transferred
to Belmarsh Prison

902
01:23:47,931 --> 01:23:50,391
where you'll be
remanded in custody

903
01:23:51,017 --> 01:23:52,768
until the Crown
Prosecution Service

904
01:23:53,352 --> 01:23:55,103
deem you fit to
stand trial for. . .

905
01:23:54,994 --> 01:23:57,162
Say my name. Say it.

906
01:23:57,694 --> 01:23:59,445
My real name.

907
01:23:59,835 --> 01:24:01,461
I know you remember it.

908
01:24:02,616 --> 01:24:04,617
Your name is on
the memorial wall

909
01:24:04,659 --> 01:24:06,702
of the very
building you attacked.

910
01:24:08,429 --> 01:24:10,096
I will have it struck off.

911
01:24:10,631 --> 01:24:14,968
Soon your past
will be as nonexistent
as your future.

912
01:24:15,378 --> 01:24:17,462
I'll never see you again.

913
01:24:19,820 --> 01:24:21,821
Do you know what
it does to you?

914
01:24:23,818 --> 01:24:25,903
Hydrogen cyanide?

915
01:24:38,342 --> 01:24:40,844
Look upon your work,

916
01:24:41,630 --> 01:24:42,922

919
01:25:23,172 --> 01:25:25,340
Let me know what you recover
from his computer.

920
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:29,500
Has he transmitted the lists?
If so, to whom?
I want this resolved.

921
01:25:29,692 --> 01:25:30,775
Yes, ma'am.

922
01:25:35,484 --> 01:25:37,902
His name is Tiago Rodriguez.

923
01:25:38,408 --> 01:25:39,908
He was a brilliant agent.

924
01:25:41,084 --> 01:25:44,253
But he started
operating beyond his brief,
hacking the Chinese.

925
01:25:45,029 --> 01:25:49,116
The handover was coming up
and they were onto him,
so I gave him up.

926
01:25:50,114 --> 01:25:53,241
I got six agents in return
and a peaceful transition.

927
01:25:54,020 --> 01:25:56,897
We should go, ma'am.
Board of Inquiry
begins in 30 minutes.

928
01:25:57,003 --> 01:25:59,088
I want to know
what's on that computer.

929
01:26:10,782 --> 01:26:13,284
Now, looking at
Silva's computer,

930
01:26:14,923 --> 01:26:18,843
it seems to me he's done
a number of
slightly unusual things.

931
01:26:18,687 --> 01:26:21,689
He's established
failsafe protocols
to wipe the memory

932
01:26:22,001 --> 01:26:24,545
if there's any
attempt to access
certain files.

933
01:26:25,551 --> 01:26:28,261
Only six people in the world
could program
safeguards like that.

934
01:26:28,596 --> 01:26:30,597
Of course there are.
Can you get past them?

935
01:26:31,573 --> 01:26:33,074
I invented them.

936
01:26:34,583 --> 01:26:35,750
Right, then.

937
01:26:37,708 --> 01:26:40,585
Let's see what you've
got for us, Mr. Silva.

938
01:26:41,752 --> 01:26:43,169
We're in.

939

(EXHALES)

940
01:26:51,243 --> 01:26:53,786
Sir, what do you make of this?

941
01:26:57,607 --> 01:26:59,316
It's his Omega site.

942
01:27:01,477 --> 01:27:03,145
Most encrypted level he has.

943
01:27:04,161 --> 01:27:07,914
Looks like obfuscated code
to conceal its true purpose.

944
01:27:09,862 --> 01:27:11,988
Security through obscurity.

945
01:27:14,691 --> 01:27:17,234
Ladies and gentlemen,
if I might have order?

946
01:27:18,250 --> 01:27:19,875
I'd like to begin
the proceedings.

947
01:27:22,017 --> 01:27:24,685
We're gathered today
to address important issues

948
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:27,663
concerning the future
of our national security.

(GROANS LOUDLY)

950
01:27:32,942 --> 01:27:34,568
Going somewhere?

951
01:27:36,079 --> 01:27:39,373
So you believe your
stewardship of Ml6
during the recent crisis

952
01:27:40,836 --> 01:27:42,170
has been up to scratch?

953
01:27:42,793 --> 01:27:45,879
Well,
I believe we have apprehended
the responsible party

954
01:27:45,710 --> 01:27:47,461
and are taking
all necessary steps

955
01:27:47,832 --> 01:27:50,542
to ensure that
the sensitive information
is contained.

956
01:27:51,031 --> 01:27:52,281
Oh,

957
01:27:52,326 --> 01:27:53,952
so it's a job well done.

958
01:27:54,045 --> 01:27:55,754
I'm not saying
it's gone perfectly, but. . .

959
01:27:55,527 --> 01:27:58,154
You'll forgive me
for not putting
up the bunting.

960
01:27:59,038 --> 01:28:00,914
I find it rather difficult
to overlook monumental

961
01:28:00,858 --> 01:28:02,776
security breaches
and dead operatives

962
01:28:03,582 --> 01:28:06,375
for which you are almost
single-handedly responsible.

963
01:28:07,195 --> 01:28:09,697
He's using
a polymorphic engine
to mutate the code.

964
01:28:10,545 --> 01:28:12,754
Whenever I try to
gain access, it changes.

965
01:28:13,485 --> 01:28:15,987
It's like
solving a Rubik's cube
that's fighting back.

966
01:28:22,483 --> 01:28:23,525
Stop.

967
01:28:24,315 --> 01:28:25,732
Go in on that.

968
01:28:31,563 --> 01:28:32,605

969
01:28:34,519 --> 01:28:38,314

It's an old Tube station
on the Metropolitan Line.

01:28:58,093 --> 01:28:59,177
It's London.

974
01:29:00,353 --> 01:29:02,646

how the hell he
got into our system?

you should be in the Tube.

I'm in the Tube.

Bond, this isn't an escape.
This was years
in the planning.

995
01:30:41,778 --> 01:30:44,363

capture him, he wanted us
to access his computer.

Knowing we'd
retreat down here.

It's what he's got
planned next that worries me.

There's a service
door on your left.
